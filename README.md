1. Users can create an account, sign in using a previous account, or logout if they are currently signed in using the navigation bar at the top of the page.

2. Creating an account prompts the user to enter their name, email, and password, requiring a verified matching password for quality of life purposes.

3. Signing in requires only the email and password used for account creation

4. After signing in, a dashboard option will appear on the navigation bar, and the create account option will dissapear. Users will see their classrooms they have joined (empty if account is brand new), and will have options to create or join a classroom as well.

5. Creating a classroom requires only a classname, which will then autogenerate a unique and permanent join code for other accounts to become students within your class. The creator of the classroom has specific admin privileges.

6. Clicking on a classroom box on your dashboard will show this screen if you are the administrator. The code is the join code others will use to join your classroom.

7. Teachers can either create an assignment with a description, view a list of all created assignments and their descriptions (sortable alphabetically and reserve alphabetically), or view the list of students in their class (sortable as well). Teachers can return back to their specific classroom by clicking the home button.

9. In this way, educators can more subtly check on their students without singling them out, increasing the likelihood of a student reaching out for help.

11. Clicking on an assignment reveals the assignment description, a selectable colour to submit (based on how they are doing with the assignment/subject), and additional comments to submite if needed as well.
